### Project Description 

We are making a website for a local Pizza store, customers often ask about our discounts and items sold at our store since as a local pizza store we make it of vital importance to only sell fresh pizza and other food items, and most times that would collide with our uber east platform. Which is why making a website for our store was essential for us.

This project will contain current and modern website design to make accessibility and interactive design which will be useful for customers, the chef and the management to be able to process orders, payments and support.

New Discounts, fresh products will be updated on a daily/ weekly basis which are the primary requirements that are required by pizza store owners. We will do so using AWS deployment and websockets to maintain updated code without worrying about failure or crash.

### Problem

The pizza shop is facing difficulties keeping up with modern customer expectations due to outdated ordering methods and limited access to information. Customers often struggle to see updated menus, discover new dishes or specials, or know the restaurant’s exact hours. Orders must be taken manually by staff, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and tiring, especially during busy times. When certain menu items are unavailable, servers have to explain this to customers only after they’ve ordered, which creates disappointment and frustration. It is also inconvenient for customers to leave feedback or reviews, since there is no simple way to share their experiences or read what others have said. In addition, the restaurant’s reach is limited, as many people in the community may not even realize it exists. These ongoing challenges reduce customer satisfaction, put more strain on staff, and make it harder for the shop to compete with larger chains that provide faster, more reliable, and more convenient experiences.

### Solution

To overcome these challenges, the pizza shop will have a modern and interactive website that streamlines both customer and management experiences. Customers will be able to easily browse an up-to-date menu, view food details, and add items to a shopping cart for quick checkout. Special offers, promotions, and new dishes will be highlighted to increase customer engagement, while clear navigation ensures visitors can find information such as hours, address, and store specialties with ease. Online ordering will reduce manual errors and improve efficiency, while real-time order displays and notifications help staff manage operations more effectively. Input validation, menu editing tools, and admin permissions will ensure that the system remains secure and reliable. Additionally, features like integrated customer feedback, ratings, and reviews will make it more convenient for customers to share their experiences, while dashboards and sales reports give management insights to grow the business.


### Technological tools

This solution will be implemented using a modern web development stack. We will make a website that helps the chef and team to be able to effectively make and process orders well. The backend part of the development process will use Node.js with Express js in order to handle the customer purchases and orders. The database portion of the Website development will use Mongo DB, to save information- orders, history, users etc. The front end development of this site will use react.js. In order to create a responsive and interactive design. The application will be deployed to AWS for quick accessibility.
